Getting the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) certification was a big achievement for me, as it was my first cybersecurity certification. It helped me improve my skills in penetration testing and gave me hands-on experience. In this post, I‚Äôll share how I prepared and give some tips to help you pass the eJPT.

## Why I Chose eJPT

I chose this certification because it is an entry-level certification with a fair price. Whether you're just starting or looking for a challenge, I recommend it.

## The Exam

The exam is 48h exam consisting of 35 questions.

It covers the following skills:

- Assessment Methodologies
- Host and Networking Auditing
- Host and Network Penetration Testing
- Web Application Penetration Testing

## The course

The associated course, called PTS (Penetration Testing Student), is a mix of videos, PDFs, and labs. It took me two months to complete because I was also studying for my [Master‚Äôs in Cybersecurity](https://blueh0rse.github.io/posts/mscyber) at the same time, and I didn‚Äôt want to skip any materials. Since this was my first certification, I wanted to do everything right.

## What I liked

Since this is my first certification, I don‚Äôt have much to compare it to, but here are my thoughts:

1. Alexis Ahmed, the main instructor, is very good. He explains everything clearly and provides examples.
2. There are many labs, so if you don‚Äôt want to watch all the videos, you can still practice with the labs and save time.
3. The course revisits topics multiple times. At first, I found this a bit repetitive, but in the end, it was helpful. If you forget something, there‚Äôs a good chance it will come up again later in the course, often in a different context to explain another aspect.

## What I didn't like

1. The second instructor, Josh Mason, just reads the PDFs he‚Äôs presenting without adding much extra information.
2. The exam is done in a browser-based Kali VM, which can be very frustrating if your internet connection isn‚Äôt stable. I had to refresh the page too many times.

## My tips

- Note all the commands shown in the course
- Summarize your notes in a cheatsheet, you will save a lot of time during the exam
- Read all the questions multiple times before starting anything! It will give you a good understanding of the overall target structure

## Conclusion

Overall, passing the eJPT was a great learning experience for me. It not only gave me hands-on skills in penetration testing but also boosted my confidence to pursue more advanced certifications.

Good luck for it! If you have any questions feel free to contact me :)
