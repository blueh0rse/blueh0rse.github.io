Getting the eLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) certification was a big achievement for me as it was my first cybersecurity certification. It helped me improve my skills in penetration testing and gave me hands-on experience. In this post, I‚Äôll share how I prepared and offer some tips to help you pass the eJPT.

## Why I Chose eJPT

I chose this certification because it is an entry level certification with a fair price. As a first start or for the challenge I recommend it.

## The exam

The exam is 48h exam consisting of 35 questions.

It covers the following skills:

- Assessment Methodologies
- Host and Networking Auditing
- Host and Network Penetration Testing
- Web Application Penetration Testing

## The course

The associated course called PTS (Penetation Testing Student) is a mix of videos, pdfs and labs. It took me 2 months to complete it because I was also studying for my Master of Cybersecurity at the same time and I didn't wanted to skip any materials. For my first certification I wanted to do everything good.

## What I liked

As it is my first certification I don't have any comparison but here are my takes:

1. Alexis Ahmed the main instructor is very good. He explains everything and give examples.
2. There are many labs so if you don't want to look at all the videos to save time there are many labs to let you practice.
3. The course presents subjects then later go back to it. I felt this very redundant at the beginning but in the end it was appreciable. If you forget something there are chances it will be presented again later in the course to showcase another aspect for example.  

## What I didn't like

1. The second instructor Josh Mason is basically just reading the pdf he's presenting and not giving more information.
2. The exam has to be done is a browser based Kali VM... Very frustrating when the internet connection is not the best. I had to refresh the page a thousand of time easy.

## My tips

- Note all the commands shown in the course
- Summarize your notes in a cheatsheet, you will save a lot of time during the exam
- Read all the questions multiple times before starting anything! It will give you a good understanding of the overall target structure
