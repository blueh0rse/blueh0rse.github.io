# Introduction

TryHackMe is a beginner friendly cybersecurity platform where you can learn many fields of cybersecurity by most of the time reading some theory / explanation then practicing with challenges.

# Paths
The platform is organised by paths, modules and rooms.

Path are just groups of modules.
Modules are composed of rooms.
Rooms are byte-sized challenges on a specific theme like 'Intro to cryptography' or 'How to use Burp Suite'.

As this date there are 8 paths :

| Path                          | Difficulty    | Modules | Rooms | Done     |
|:----------------------------- |--------------:|--------:|------:|---------:|
| COMPLETE BEGINNER             | Easy          | 8       | 34    | __100%__ |
| INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY | Easy          | 3       | 8     | 45%      |
| WEB FUNDAMENTALS              | Easy          | 4       | 26    | __100%__ |
| PRE SECURITY                  | Easy          | 5       | 18    | __100%__ |
| COMPTIA PENTEST               | Easy          | 4       | 18    | 82%      |
| CYBER DEFENSE                 | Intermediate  | 6       | 35    | 28%      |
| JR PENETRATION TESTER         | Intermediate  | 8       | 38    | __100%__ |
| OFFENSIVE PENTESTING          | Intermediate  | 5       | 25    | 42%      |

I am currently working on the __OFENSIVE PENTESTING__.

Below you can find all the writeups I did for each path:

# OFFENSIVE PENTESTING
The aim of this path is to make you ready for real world penetration testing by teaching you how to use industry standard tools along with a methodology to find vulnerabilities in machines. By the time you complete this path, you will be well prepared for interviews and jobs as a penetration tester. To complete this path you should have a basic to medium understanding of computing.
