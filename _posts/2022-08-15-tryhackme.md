# Introduction

TryHackMe is a beginner friendly cybersecurity platform where you can learn many fields of cybersecurity by most of the time reading some theory / explanation then practicing with challenges.

# Paths
The platform is organised by paths, modules and rooms.

Path are just groups of modules.
Modules are composed of rooms.
Rooms are byte-sized challenges on a specific theme like 'Intro to cryptography' or 'How to use Burp Suite'.


As this date there are 8 paths :
* COMPLETE BEGINNER (64 hours)
* INTRODUCTION TO CYBERSECURITY (24 hours)
* WEB FUNDAMENTALS (32 hours)
* PRE SECURITY (40 hours)
* COMPTIA PENTEST+ (51 hours)
* CYBER DEFENSE (48 hours)
* JR PENETRATION TESTER (54 hours)
* OFFENSIVE PENTESTING (47 hours)

I completed some of them :
