4th challenge of the _Advanced Exploitation_ module called __Game Zone__.

On the introduction of the challenge we can read that we will use some SQL injection manually then using SQLMap. Plus we will do some password cracking, manipulating SSH tunnels to reveal a hidden service and use Metasploit to gain root privileges.

First thing to do: deploy the machine.

>For this writeup I will say that the IP adresses are the following: 
>
> - __attack machine__ is `10.10.10.1`
> 
> - __target machine__ is `10.10.10.2`
{: .prompt-warning }

# Task #1 - Deploy the vulnerable machine
Now the machine is online we can start doing some port enumeration with ``nmap``.

We will do a basic scan like: 

````bash
nmap -sC -sV -vv 10.10.10.2
````

Little explanation of the options :
-sC
: Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to --script=default. Some of the scripts in this category are considered intrusive and should not be run against a target network without permission.

-sV
: Enables version detection

-vv
: Max verbosity level

After few minutes we can see two interesting running services :
* Port 80 : http server named 'Game Zone'
* Port 22 : ssh OpenSSH 7.2p2

Let's see the web server first.

We can easily identify Hitman on the landing page but I don't kow his real name. After googling it :

# Task #2 - Obtain access via SQLi
SQL is a standard language for storing, editing and retrieving data in databases. A query can look like so:

````sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = my_password AND password = my_password
````

Because we don't have a valid username/password pair we will try to bybass the authentication form using SQL injection.

In the login field I write ``username = ' or 1=1 -- -``

Instead of giving a username and a password to the form I simply escape the username input using the `'` because strings are always stored between `' '` or `" "`. Then I add the condition ``or 1=1`` and comment all the rest of the query with the double dashes ``--``.

>In simple words it will say to the database:  
> 
> __If 1=1 the user is authenticated__. 
{: .prompt-info }

> When you've logged in, what page do you get redirected to?
> 
> __portal.php__
{: .prompt-tip }

# Task #3 - Using SQLMap
We will use SQLMap to dump all the database info.
We first have to capture a request within Burp of the search bar in portal.php

You can put anything you want in the search bar and intercept the request.
Copy all the raw body in a text file (req.txt for exemple). To make it works I had to remove all the blank lines of the file except the one before __searchitem__ (the last line)

Now we can use SQLMap like this

````bash
sqlmap -r req.txt --dbms=mysql --dump
````

Where:
--r
: specifies a file containin the request

---dbms
: specifies which Database Management System is used by the website 

---dump
: Dump DBMS database table entries

Here it's said that the dbms is MySQL but in real cases we would have to do some enumeration to identify it.

Now we have to wait a moment for SQLMap to finish. If asked to extend the tests for MySQL answer ``Y``. If asked anything else you can answer ``y``.

When SQLMap finished we can see 2 tables in the database : __users__ and __post__.
In _users_ SQLMap found just one entry and gave us the hashed password and the username related.

> In the users table, what is the hashed password?
>
> __If you followed the steps it should appears on your screen when SQLMap ends.__
{: .prompt-tip }

> What was the username associated with the hashed password?
>
> __agent47__
{: .prompt-tip }

>What was the other table name?
>
> __post__
{: .prompt-tip }

# Task #4 - Cracking a password with JohnTheRipper
Now that we have a username and a hashed password we can try to crack the hash to reveal it.
for This we will use John The Ripper a 15y old very famous cracking program.

The basic command is the following :

````bash
john @hash --wordlist=@wordlist --format=@format
````

- @hash
: the file containing the hash(es) (hash.txt for exemple)
- @wordlist
: the worlist (rockyou.txt for exemple)
- @format
: the hash(es) type (md5crypt for exemple)

>To list all the supported formats by john you can use the following command:
>
> ``john --list=formats``
{: .prompt-info }

Before using john we first have to identify the hashtype of the discovered hash.
For this there are many websites which can help you finding the type, I personally use [__Tunnels UP__](https://www.tunnelsup.com/hash-analyzer/).

After finding the good hash format we can now launch ``john``.

In few seconds we obtain the password.

>What is the de-hashed password?
>
> __if you followed the previous steps _john_ should give it to you very quickly__
{: .prompt-tip }

We can now try to log into the machine using ssh

````bash
ssh agent47@10.10.10.2
````

>What is the user flag?.
>
> __Just ``ls`` and the flag is there.__
{: .prompt-tip }

# Task #5 - Exposing services with reverse SSH tunnels
Now using a tool called ``ss`` we will look at the running sockets on the victim machine.
````console
agent47@gamezone:~$ ss -tulnp
Netid  State      Recv-Q Send-Q                  Local Address:Port                                 Peer Address:Port

tcp    LISTEN     0      80                          127.0.0.1:3306                                            *:*

````

Here are the detailed options:
--t
: Display TCP sockets

--u
: Display UDP sockets

--l
: Displays only listening sockets

--n
: Doesn't resolve service names

--p
: Shows the process using the socket

>How many TCP sockets are running?
>
> __5__
{: .prompt-tip }

We can identify a service running on port ``10000`` but can't be accessed from outside because blocked by a firewall.

We will use a ssh tunnel from our mmachine to redirect the traffic of the blocked service to our localhost interface. Thus we will be able to see and interact with the blocked content.

````bash
ssh -L 10000:localhost:10000 agent47@10.10.10.2
firefox localhost:10000 &
````

If it works we should arrive to a login page where you can instantly identify the CMS used.

>What is the name of the exposed CMS?
>
> __Webmin__
{: .prompt-tip }

Now we need to find the credentials to access the admin panel.

I first tried ``admin:admin`` in the login form but it failed.
Then I looked on internet for the default creds and they said it's the root user (thus the user we are logged in with ssh).

When logged in it is not hard to find the CMS version.

>What is the CMS version?
>
> __1.580__
{: .prompt-tip }

# Tasks #6 - Privilege escalation with Metasploit
We have a CMS name and a version. Now time to look for vulnerabilities.

After some researches I found that this server was vulnerable to a CVE : __CVE-2012-2982__.

Let's play with ``metasploit``.

````console
$ msfconsole -q
msf5 > search CVE-2012-2982

# Conclusion
A cool challenge introducing SSH tunnels with a mix of web and privesc.
