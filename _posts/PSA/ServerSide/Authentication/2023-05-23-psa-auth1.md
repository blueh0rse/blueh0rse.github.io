## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password.

To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.

## âœ… Solution

First let's try to login with any creds:

![wrong credentials](/psa/auth/psa-auth-1-1.png){: width="830" height="560" }
_Log in with wrong credentials_

We can see a message saying "Invalid username".

Let's look at the query using Burp:

````text
username=abc&password=def
````

We will brute-force the username using a Sniper attack with the provided wordlist.

````text
username=Â§abcÂ§&password=def
````

![username brute-force](/psa/auth/psa-auth-1-3.png){: width="830" height="560" }
_Username brute-force results_

Sorting the results by response length set one username apart: `puppet`.

If we try it:

![good username](/psa/auth/psa-auth-1-4.png){: width="830" height="560" }
_Log in with good username_

We have the username, we can repeat the same attack for the password:

````text
username=puppet&password=Â§defÂ§
````

![password brute-force](/psa/auth/psa-auth-1-5.png){: width="830" height="560" }
_Password brute-force results_

Again, sorting the results by response length set one password apart: `11111111`.

Let's try it on the form:

![good credentials](/psa/auth/psa-auth-1-6.png){: width="830" height="560" }
_Log in with good credentials_

Challenge done âœ…
