Firstly, thanx for visiting my blog and looking at my work.

I am a young person who wish to start a career in cybersecurity.

I am mainly writing this blog for 3 reasons:
* Share my cybersecurity passion
* Improve my english writting skills
* Get a job as a Pentester

My current roadmap is:
- [ ] Do a lot of PortSwigger Academy challenges
- [ ] Do some HackTheBox machines
- [ ] Study, take and pass the eJPT certification
