Firstly, thanx for visiting my blog and looking at my work.
I am a student who wish to start a career in cybersecurity.

I am mainly writing this blog for 3 reasons :
* Share my cybersecurity passion
* Improve my english writting skills
* Get a job as a Cybersecurity Engineer

The next steps I planned are the following :
1. Finish the Offensive Pentesting path of TryHackMe
2. Do some challenges on HackTheBox & RootMe
3. Study, take and pass the eJPT certification
